Game Rules

Nimble:
Two players confront each other on a one-dimensional board of n squares. At the beginning, each
square contains a random number of pawns (this number can be 0). At each turn, a player chooses a
square containing at least one pawn, and moves one of the pawns to one of the squares on the left. This square can be empty or can already contains one or more pawns.
The winner is last player able to move a pawn. In other words, as soon as a player cannot move,
that player loses. It corresponds with the situation where all the pawns are on the first square of the
board.

MingMang:
It is an ancestral tibetan game. Two players confront on square board of dimension n, i.e. the board
contains n rows et n columns. The first player has black (X) pawns and the second player has while pawns (O).
The first player begin, and then alternatively the players move one of their pawns to an empty square
located on the same row or on the same column of the square, with the constraint that there are only
empty squares between the departure position and the arrival position. So, we cannot jump above
another pawn whether itâ€™s the same color or not.
If a your pawn is getting stuck between your oponent pawn your losing your pawns. XOX -> XXX
The winner is the last player able to move a pawn. In other words, as soon as a player does not have
anymore pawns or pawns able to move, he has lost.
